              How do you rate an NFL team across decades of play? One method is
              Elo, a simple measure of strength based on game-by-game results.
              We calculated Elo ratings for every game in league history — over
              30,000 ratings in total.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
              Elo is set so that an average NFL team has a rating of about 1500,
              although the league average can be slightly higher or lower,
              depending on how recently the league has expanded — expansion
              teams start with a rating of 1300. You can

            <p class="article-text">
              Before the New England Patriots’ Super Bowl win last season, we
              tried to calculate whether they had become the
              <a
                href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-patriots-are-the-nfls-greatest-dynasty/"
                >greatest NFL dynasty ever</a
              >. The answer, as always, was that it depends on how you count.
              From 2001 to 2016, the Patriots’ average season-ending Elo rating
              was 1701, the best 16-season stretch in league history. But the
              best 17-season, 18-season and 19-season stretches belong to the
              San Francisco 49ers of the 1980s and ’90s.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
              San Francisco’s Elo average from 1981 to 1998 was 1683. During
              these 18 seasons, the 49ers made the playoffs 16 times, won more
              than 10 games 17 times, and racked up five championships. The
              Patriots may have the highest peak Elo rating of all time — 1849,
              after their 18-0 start to the 2007 season — but if you were born
              in 1981, the 49ers were among the NFL’s best for your entire
              childhood. Tom Brady and Bill Belichick aren’t quite there — at
              least not yet.

            <h4>The 1990s Cowboys — A Rebuilding Project</h4>

            <p class="article-text">
              On Oct. 12, 1989, Dallas was the worst team in football. With an
              0-5 record — coming off a 3-13 season — the Cowboys weren’t giving
              their fans much reason to be optimistic. Then,
              <a
                href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thegreattraderobbery"
                target="_blank"
                >The Trade</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
              The Cowboys sent Pro Bowl running back Herschel Walker to
              Minnesota in exchange for a bevy of players and picks, which led
              to the drafting of running back Emmitt Smith, safety Darren
              Woodson and defensive tackle Russell Maryland. All three became
              huge contributors for Dallas, while Walker never surpassed 200
              carries or 1,000 yards in either of his two full seasons with the
              Vikings. It was one of the most lopsided deals in NFL history.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
              The payoff wasn’t immediate. The Cowboys finished the 1989 season
              at 1-15, bottoming out with a 1271 Elo rating. They’d make the
              playoffs two years later and win the Super Bowl the following
              season — the first of three titles in the 1990s. The Cowboys’ Elo
              rating after that championship game, in January 1993, was 1784, a
              gain of over 500 points in just three years.
